<h1>Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</h1>
<p>Daylight and everything. Throw her in the brig. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
<p>Then we'll go with that data file! Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? <strong> You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</strong> <em> Tell her you just want to talk.</em> It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
<h2>It doesn't look so shiny to me.</h2>
<p>But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. It's a T. It goes "tuh". Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Professor, make a wo
    man out of me.</p>
<ol class="loading">
    <li>Now what?</li><li>Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.</li><li>A true inspiration for the children.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</h3>
<p>I had more, but you go ahead. Say it in Russian! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. Bender, you risked your life to save me!</p>
<ul>
    <li class="loading">I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself.</li><li>Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</li><li>My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away!</p>
<p>No, I'm Santa Claus! You can see how I lived before I met you. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Hey, whatcha watching? Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</p>
<p>You don't know how to do any of those. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. What kind of a father would I be if I said no?</p>
<p>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Shut up and take my money!</p>
<p>She also liked to shut up! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. I never loved you. Say what? Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
<p>That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. It must be wonderful. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Negative, bossy meat creature!</p>
<p>Take me to your leader! Meh. Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</p>
<p class="loading">There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p>
<p class="loading">Fatal. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food.</p>
<p class="loading">File not found. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p>
<p class="loading">OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very…</p>
